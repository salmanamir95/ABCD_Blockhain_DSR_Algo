# ABCD_Blockhain_DSR_Algo

âœ… What to Build Instead: Lightweight PoPW Blockchain
Feature	Design
Consensus	PoPW (based on path scores & signatures)
Block	A record of a trusted routing path
Hashing	BLAKE3
Signatures	Ed25519
Encryption	ChaCha20-Poly1305 (if needed)
Storage	Only recent blocks, pruned often
Propagation	Gossip, opportunistic syncing
Programming	Optional rule-based filters, no smart contracts


ðŸ§± Recommended Architecture

    Language: Rust or Go

    Design Pattern: Event-driven or async message loop

    Sync Mechanism: Opportunistic gossip + store recent blocks

    Block Format: CBOR or flat JSON â†’ then encrypted + signed

    Security: Use Ed25519 for signatures, BLAKE3 for hashing

    Communication: UDP multicast or mesh-over-TCP tunnels
