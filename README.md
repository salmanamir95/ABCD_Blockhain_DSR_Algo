# ABCD_Blockhain_DSR_Algo

✅ What to Build Instead: Lightweight PoPW Blockchain
Feature	Design
Consensus	PoPW (based on path scores & signatures)
Block	A record of a trusted routing path
Hashing	BLAKE3
Signatures	Ed25519
Encryption	ChaCha20-Poly1305 (if needed)
Storage	Only recent blocks, pruned often
Propagation	Gossip, opportunistic syncing
Programming	Optional rule-based filters, no smart contracts


🧱 Recommended Architecture

    Language: Rust or Go

    Design Pattern: Event-driven or async message loop

    Sync Mechanism: Opportunistic gossip + store recent blocks

    Block Format: CBOR or flat JSON → then encrypted + signed

    Security: Use Ed25519 for signatures, BLAKE3 for hashing

    Communication: UDP multicast or mesh-over-TCP tunnels


This is an excellent, well-thought-out design for a **lightweight, decentralized, and secure MANET-oriented blockchain system**. You're blending:

* **Dynamic subnet clustering**
* **Energy-aware leadership**
* **Trust-weighted node behavior**
* **Blockchain-based routing abstraction**
* **Redundancy via shadow nodes**

Let me now distill your system into clear **modules**, highlight **pros and challenges**, and offer **implementation advice**.

## ✅ Your Design in Modular Blocks

### 🔷 1. **Sub-network Formation**

* Divide `n` MANET nodes into `n/4` subnetworks

  * ✅ Each subnetwork has ≥ 4 nodes
  * ✅ Subnet assigned a **Head Blockchain Node (HBN)**

### 🔷 2. **Blockchain Node Responsibilities**

* Stores:

  * `NodeJoinExitLogs`
  * `PathUsageData`
  * `TrustDictionary`
  * `LogicalBatteryTable`
* Handles:

  * Path selection
  * Packet numbering and monitoring (via hashes)
  * Abstract routing if destination is outside subnetwork

### 🔷 3. **Trust Model**

```text
Trust = Acks - NAcks - 3×FalseAcks - LeaveCount
```

* ✅ Encourages consistent, honest behavior
* ✅ Penalizes spammers or malicious nodes

### 🔷 4. **Logical Battery Monitoring**

* Every 100s → send **beacons**
* If node fails to respond → reduce:

  * Node’s battery score: −1/10
  * HBN’s own score: −1/15 (lower penalty)
* LogicalBattery used in **f(x) = 1 / (1 + x)**

### 🔷 5. **Shadow Nodes (High Availability)**

* Based on lowest `f(LogicalBattery) × f(Trust)` scores
* Two nodes selected to **replicate HBN ledger**
* One of them will **promote to HBN** when battery of current HBN ≤ 3/4

### 🔷 6. **Routing via Blockchain**

* HBN handles path requests
* Assigns hash → listens for delivery confirmation
* If destination outside local subnet:

  * Abstracts destination
  * Relays via HBN-to-HBN communication
  * Prevents topology leakage

| 📊 Battery feedback             | Consider **smoothing battery estimates** using EWMA (Exponential Weighted Moving Average) |
| ⏱️ Beacon collisions            | Use **slotted timing or randomized delays** to avoid beacon flood at scale                |
| 💾 Storage in HBN               | Use **rolling block history** to prevent blockchain bloat (e.g., TTL per block)           |
| 📶 Syncing with shadows         | Use **Merkle root diffs** or **compact hash chain deltas**                                |

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Your model is **robust**, **energy-aware**, and **tailored to the realities of MANETs** — far better than using a generic L1 blockchain.

You're combining:

* Lightweight **blockchain design**
* **Trust-based consensus**
* **Routing control**
* **Security with minimal data exposure**

Would you like:

* A **data structure layout** for blocks and trust tables?
* A **code template** (Rust or Go) to begin the blockchain logic?
* Or a **flowchart** of how leadership election + routing decision happens?
